# Welcome to Jekyll!

This is our first blog post using Jekyll. We're excited to share our thoughts and experiences with you.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website.

## Why We Chose Jekyll

- Simple and lightweight
- No database required
- Easy to deploy on GitHub Pages
- Great for blogs and documentation

Stay tuned for more posts about our journey with Jekyll!
