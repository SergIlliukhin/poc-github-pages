# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

## Why GitHub Pages?

- Free hosting
- Automatic deployment
- Custom domain support
- SSL encryption
- Great for personal projects and documentation

## How to Deploy

1. Create a new repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Push your Jekyll site to the repository
4. Wait for the build process to complete

That's it! Your site will be live at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`.
